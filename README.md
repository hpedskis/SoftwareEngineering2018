## About This Article
This article, titled *How Silicon Valley Came to Be a Land of ‘Bros’* discusses the roots of Silicon Valley’s gender imbalance and the predominance of tech industry "bros"as well as the overall imbalance between men and women in tech jobs. I chose this article because I think this is a relevant and important topic to discuss. Emily Chang, the author of the book being talked about in this article, brings up great points about the culture and party scene of Tech due to the large number of males.

Emily brings up a great point which echos why I chose this article, saying 
>"More importantly, Silicon Valley is controlling what we see, what we read, how we shop, how we communicate, how we relate to each other. >This is not just tech’s problem. This is society’s problem. This is the industry that is having a greater influence on humanity than >perhaps any other. And the same industry that changed the world can change this behavior."
